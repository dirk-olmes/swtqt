This project is the home of a new SWT implementation based on the Qt toolkit. This project was previously approved for eclipse.org but then due to unsolvable obstacles had to move.

SWT/Qt is EPL code based on the API of the SWT toolkit from Platform UI against QtJambi which then calls Qt. It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
